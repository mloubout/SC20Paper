	abstract = {Seismic waves radiated from an earthquake propagate in the Earth and the ground shaking is felt and recorded at (or near) the ground surface. Understanding the wave propagation with respect to the Earth's structure and the earthquake mechanisms is one of the main objectives of seismology, and predicting the strong ground shaking for moderate and large earthquakes is essential for quantitative seismic hazard assessment. The finite difference scheme for solving the wave propagation problem in elastic (sometimes anelastic) media has been more widely used since the 1970s than any other numerical methods, because of its simple formulation and implementation, and its easy scalability to large computations. This paper briefly overviews the advances in finite difference simulations, focusing particularly on earthquake mechanics and the resultant wave radiation in the near field. As the finite difference formulation is simple (interpolation is smooth), an easy coupling with other approaches is one of its advantages. A coupling with a boundary integral equation method (BIEM) allows us to simulate complex earthquake source processes.}

abstract={Accelerating stencil computations has long been studied on a great variety of platforms and a lot of work has been done on enhancing data locality in order to optimize our computations through use of cache memory. Temporal blocking, also known as time-tiling is a well-known technique for accelerating stencil based computations by enhancing data locality. Solving partial differential equations with the finite difference method yields stencil codes that can solve complex problems described by PDEs. Related work is partly solving the issues encountered in this research area however there is no framework that currently supports the modelling of real-world problems, a high-level syntax of PDE’s, automatic parallel code generation (SIMD/OpenMP/MPI) and loop nest optimizations all together. We introduce an algorithm to apply temporal blocking to phenomena with source injection and is designed to be delivered, and automated as part of the Devito framework.},

    abstract = {The retrieval of near-receiver mantle structure from scattered waves associated with teleseismic P and S and recorded on three-component, linear seismic arrays is considered in the context of inverse scattering theory. A Ray + Born formulation is proposed which admits linearization of the forward problem and economy in the computation of the elastic wave Green's function. The high-frequency approximation further simplifies the problem by enabling (1) the use of an earth-flattened, 1-D reference model, (2) a reduction in computations to 2-D through the assumption of 2.5-D experimental geometry, and (3) band-diagonalization of the Hessian matrix in the inverse formulation. The final expressions are in a form reminiscent of the classical diffraction stack of seismic migration. Implementation of this procedure demands an accurate estimate of the scattered wave contribution to the impulse response, and thus requires the removal of both the reference wavefield and the source time signature from the raw record sections. An approximate separation of direct and scattered waves is achieved through application of the inverse free-surface transfer operator to individual station records and a Karhunen–Loeve transform to the resulting record sections. This procedure takes the full displacement field to a wave vector space wherein the first principal component of the incident wave-type section is identified with the direct wave and is used as an estimate of the source time function. The scattered displacement field is reconstituted from the remaining principal components using the forward free-surface transfer operator, and may be reduced to a scattering impulse response upon deconvolution of the source estimate. An example employing pseudo-spectral synthetic seismograms demonstrates an application of the methodology.},

  abstract	= {We studied second-order wave propagation systems for
	vertical transversely isotropic (VTI) and tilted
	transversely isotropic (TTI) acoustic media with variable
	axes of symmetry that have their shear-wave speeds set to
	zero. Acoustic TTI systems are commonly used in
	reverse-time migration, but these second-order systems are
	susceptible to instablities appearing as nonphysical
	stationary noise growing linearly in time, particularly in
	variable-tilt TTI media. We found an explanation of the
	cause of this phenomenon. The instabilities are not caused
	only by the numerical schemes; they are inherent to the
	differential equations. These instabilities are present
	even in homogeneous VTI media. These instabilities are
	caused by zero wave speeds at a wide variety of wavenumbers
	--- a direct consequence of setting the shear-wave speeds
	to zero --- coupled with the second time derivative in
	these systems. Although the second-order isotropic wave
	equation allows smooth time-growing solutions, a larger
	class of time-growing solutions exists for the second-order
	acoustic TI systems, including nonsmooth solutions.
	Boundary conditions appear to be less effective in
	controlling these time-growing solutions than they are for
	the isotropic wave equation. These systems conserve an
	incomplete energy that does not prevent the instabilities.
	The corresponding steady-state systems are no longer
	elliptic differential equations and can have nonsmooth
	solutions that are related to the instabilities. We started
	initially with homogeneous VTI media, and then extended
	these results to heterogeneous variable-tilt TTI media. We
	also developed a second-order acoustic system for
	heterogeneous variable-tilt TTI media derived directly from
	the full-elastic system for heterogeneous variable-tilt TTI
	media. All second-order systems with a dispersion relation
	obtained by setting the shear-wave speeds to zero in the
	elastic dispersion relation allowed these nonphysical
	time-growing solutions; however, knowing the cause of these
	instabilities, it may be possible to prevent or control the
	activation of these solutions. },

	Systems with positive shear wavespeeds behave better, but

	projection method to allow using zero shear wavespeeds in
	isotropic and elliptic subregions. We also obtain a more
	thorough resolution to these issues by modifying a popular
	second-order system with positive shear wavespeeds so that
	it both has a complete conserved energy, and also decouples
	into a single second-order equation and a second
	identically-zero equation in isotropic and elliptically
	anisotropic regions. This new system stays stable even in
	strongly variable media when the simple but usually
	effective projection method fails. },

    abstract = { One of the nagging problems which arises in application of discrete solution methods for wave‐propagation calculations is the presence of reflections or wraparound from the boundaries of the numerical mesh. These undesired events eventually override the actual seismic signals which propagate in the modeled region. The solution to avoiding boundary effects used to be to enlarge the numerical mesh, thus delaying the side reflections and wraparound longer than the range of times involved in the modeling. Obviously this solution considerably increases the expense of computation. More recently, nonreflecting boundary conditions were introduced for the finite‐difference method (Clayton and Enquist, 1977; Reynolds, 1978). These boundary conditions are based on replacing the wave equation in the boundary region by one‐way wave equations which do not permit energy to propagate from the boundaries into the numerical mesh. This approach has been relatively successful, except that its effectiveness degrades for events which impinge on the boundaries at shallow angles. It is also not clear how to apply this type of boundary condition to global discrete methods such as the Fourier method for which all grid points are coupled. }

  abstract	= { Pseudoacoustic anisotropic wave equations are simplified
	elastic wave equations obtained by setting the S-wave
	velocity to zero along the anisotropy axis of symmetry.
	These pseudoacoustic wave equations greatly reduce the
	computational cost of modeling and imaging compared to the
	full elastic wave equation while preserving P-wave
	kinematics very well. For this reason, they are widely used
	in reverse time migration (RTM) to account for anisotropic
	effects. One fundamental shortcoming of this pseudoacoustic
	approximation is that it only prevents S-wave propagation
	along the symmetry axis and not in other directions. This
	problem leads to the presence of unwanted S-waves in P-wave
	simulation results and brings artifacts into P-wave RTM
	images. More significantly, the pseudoacoustic wave
	equations become unstable for anisotropy parameters ϵ<δ
	and for heterogeneous models with highly varying dip and
	azimuth angles in tilted transversely isotropic (TTI)
	media. Pure acoustic anisotropic wave equations completely
	decouple the P-wave response from the elastic wavefield and
	naturally solve all the above-mentioned problems of the
	pseudoacoustic wave equations without significantly
	increasing the computational cost. In this work, we propose
	new pure acoustic TTI wave equations and compare them with
	the conventional coupled pseudoacoustic wave equations. Our
	equations can be directly solved using either the
	finite-difference method or the pseudospectral method. We
	give two approaches to derive these equations. One employs
	Taylor series expansion to approximate the
	pseudodifferential operator in the decoupled P-wave
	equation, and the other uses isotropic and elliptically
	anisotropic dispersion relations to reduce the temporal
	frequency order of the P-SV dispersion equation. We use
	several numerical examples to demonstrate that the newly
	derived pure acoustic wave equations produce highly
	accurate P-wave results, very close to results produced by
	coupled pseudoacoustic wave equations, but completely free
	from S-wave artifacts and instabilities. }

  abstract	= { Reverse time migration (RTM) images reflectors by using
	time-extrapolation modeling codes to synthesize source and
	receiver wavefields in the subsurface. Asymptotic analysis
	of wave propagation in transversely isotropic (TI) media
	yields a dispersion relation describing coupled P- and
	SV-wave modes. This dispersion relation can be converted
	into a fourth-order scalar partial differential equation
	(PDE). Increased computational efficiency can be achieved
	using equivalent coupled second-order PDEs. Analysis of the
	corresponding dispersion relations as matrix eigenvalue
	systems allows one to characterize all possible coupled
	linear second-order systems equivalent to a given linear
	fourth-order PDE and to determine which ones yield
	optimally efficient finite-difference implementations.
	Setting the shear velocity along the axis of symmetry to
	zero yields a simpler approximate TI wave equation that is
	more efficient to implement. This simpler approximation,
	however, can become unstable for some plausible
	combinations of anisotropic parameters. The same
	eigensystem analysis can be applied using finite vertical
	shear velocity to obtain solutions that avoid these
	instability problems. },

    abstract = {The existence of seismic discontinuities within the continental upper mantle has long been recognized, with more recent studies often indicating an association with elastic anisotropy. Their near-vertical sampling renders teleseismic P and S waves suitable for characterization of mantle discontinuities, but computationally efficient methods of calculating synthetic seismograms are required for structures that exhibit lateral variability. We consider lithospheric models consisting of planar, homogeneous anisotropic layers with arbitrary dip. We adopt the traveltime equation of Diebold for dipping, plane-layered media as the basis for a high-frequency asymptotic method that does not require ray tracing. Traveltimes of plane waves in anisotropic media are calculated from simple analytic formulae involving the depths of layers beneath a station and the vertical components of phase slowness within the layers. We compute amplitudes using the reflection and transmission matrices for planar interfaces separating homogeneous anisotropic media. Modelling indicates that upper-mantle seismic responses depend in a complex fashion on both layer dip and anisotropy, particularly in the case of converted phases. Azimuthal anisotropy generally displays a distinctive 180° backazimuthal periodicity in Ps conversion amplitude, as opposed to the 360° symmetry produced by dip. In contrast, anisotropy with a steeply plunging axis may under certain conditions be difficult to distinguish from interface dip, as both exhibit a 360° symmetry. We demonstrate the application of the method on Ps and Sp conversion data from the Yellowknife Array, which show evidence for both dipping and anisotropic layering, attributed to layers of anisotropi c fabric in the upper mantle associated with ancient subducted slabs.},

	The computational cost and memory requirements of such

	a few {\quotedblbase}simultaneous{\textquotedblright}
	sources. This effectively reduces the cost of the forward

	solve. We discuss two solution methodologies: namely sample
	average approximation and stochastic approximation. To
	illustrate the effectiveness of our approach we present two
	model problems, direct current resistivity and seismic

	abstract = {Seismic inversion and imaging are adjoint-based optimization problems that processes up to terabytes of data, regularly exceeding the memory capacity of available computers. Data compression is an effective strategy to reduce this memory requirement by a certain factor, particularly if some loss in accuracy is acceptable. A popular alternative is checkpointing, where data is stored at selected points in time, and values at other times are recomputed as needed from the last stored state. This allows arbitrarily large adjoint computations with limited memory, at the cost of additional recomputations. In this paper we combine compression and checkpointing for the first time to compute a realistic seismic inversion. The combination of checkpointing and compression allows larger adjoint computations compared to using only compression, and reduces the recomputation overhead significantly compared to using only checkpointing.},

  abstract	= {Simultaneous marine acquisition is an economic way to
	sample seismic data and speed up acquisition, wherein
	single or multiple source vessels fire sources at
	near-simultaneous or slightly random times, resulting in
	overlapping shot records. The current paradigm for
	simultaneous towed-streamer marine acquisition incorporates
	{\textquotedblleft}low variability{\textquotedblright} in
	source firing times, i.e., 0 <= 1 or 2 s because the
	sources and receivers are moving. This results in a low
	degree of randomness in simultaneous data, which is
	challenging to separate (into its constituent sources)
	using compressed-sensing-based separation techniques
	because randomization is key to successful recovery via
	compressed sensing. We have addressed the challenge of
	source separation for simultaneous towed-streamer
	acquisitions via two compressed-sensing-based approaches,
	i.e., sparsity promotion and rank minimization. We have
	evaluated the performance of the sparsity-promotion- and
	rank-minimization-based techniques by simulating two
	simultaneous towed-streamer acquisition scenarios, i.e.,
	over/under and simultaneous long offset. A field data
	example from the Gulf of Suez for the over/under
	acquisition scenario was also developed. We observed that
	the proposed approaches gave good and comparable recovery
	qualities of the separated sources, but the
	rank-minimization technique outperformed the
	sparsity-promoting technique in terms of the computational
	time and memory. We also compared these two techniques with
	the normal-moveout-based median-filtering-type approach,
	which had comparable results.},

  abstract	= {Time-domain Full-Waveform Inversion (FWI) aims to image
	the subsurface of the earth accurately from field recorded
	data and can be solved via the reduced adjoint-state
	method. However, this method requires access to the forward
	and adjoint wavefields that are meet when computing
	gradient updates. The challenge here is that the adjoint
	wavefield is computed in reverse order during time stepping
	and therefore requires storage or other type of mitigation
	because storing the full time history of the forward
	wavefield is too expensive in realistic 3D settings. To
	overcome this challenge, we propose an approximate
	adjoint-state method where the wavefields are subsampled
	randomly, which drastically the amount of storage needed.
	By using techniques from stochastic optimization, we
	control the errors induced by the subsampling. Examples of
	the proposed technique on a synthetic but realistic 2D
	model show that the subsampling-related artifacts can be
	reduced significantly by changing the sampling for each
	source after each model update. Combination of this
	gradient approximation with a quasi-Newton method shows
	virtually artifact free inversion results requiring only
	5\% of storage compared to saving the history at Nyquist.
	In addition, we avoid having to recompute the wavefields as
	is required by checkpointing.},

	effort has been invested that the performance bottlenecks
	of a PDE solver are fully understood, and the precise
	details varies between different computer architectures.
	One way to mitigate this issue is to establish a reliable
	performance model that allows a numerical analyst to make
	reliable predictions of how well a numerical method would
	perform on a given computer architecture, before embarking
	upon potentially long and expensive implementation and

	informs the developer on what kind of optimisations are
	beneficial, and when the maximum expected performance has
	been reached and optimisation work should stop. We show how
	discretization of a wave-equation can be theoretically
	studied to understand the performance limitations of the

In certain cases, extension of the search space, e.g. by making the wavefields or focused matched sources additional unknowns, has removed some of these non-uniqueness issues but these rely on time-harmonic formulations.

	abstract = {Seismic inversion, and more generally geophysical exploration, aims at better understanding the earth{\textquoteright}s subsurface, which is one of today{\textquoteright}s most important challenges. Firstly, it contains natural resources that are critical to our technologies such as water, minerals and oil and gas. Secondly, monitoring the subsurface in the context of CO2 sequestration, earthquake detection and global seismology are of major interests with regard to safety and the environment hazards. However, the technologies to monitor the subsurface or find resources are scientifically extremely challenging. Seismic inversion can be formulated as a mathematical optimization problem that minimizes the difference between field recorded data and numerically modeled synthetic data. The process of solving this optimization problem then requires to numerically model, thousands of times, wave-propagation in large three-dimensional representations of part of the earth subsurface. The mathematical and computational complexity of this problem, therefore, calls for software design that abstracts these requirements and facilitates algorithm and software development. My thesis addresses some of the challenges that arise from these problems; mainly the computational cost and access to the right software for research and development. In the first part, I will discuss a performance metric that improves the current runtime-only benchmarks in exploration geophysics. This metric, the roofline model, first provides insight at the hardware level of the performance of a given implementation relative to the maximum achievable performance. Second, this study demonstrates that the choice of numerical discretization has a major impact on the achievable performance depending on the hardware at hand and shows that a flexible framework with respect to the discretization parameters is necessary. In the second part, I will introduce and describe Devito, a symbolic finite-difference DSL that provides a high-level interface to the definition of partial differential equations (PDE) such as the wave equation. Devito, from the symbolic definition of PDEs, then generates and compiles highly optimized C code on-the-fly to compute the solution of the PDE. The combination of the high-level abstractions and the just-in-time compiler enable research for geophysical exploration and PDE-constrainted optimization based on the paradigm of separation of concerns. This allows researchers to concentrate on their respective field of study while having access to computationally performant solvers with a flexible and easy to use interface to successfully implement complex representations of the physics. The second part of my thesis will be split into two sub-parts; first describing the symbolic application programming interface (API), before describing and benchmarking the just-in-time compiler. I will end my thesis with concluding remarks, the latest developments and a brief description of projects that were enabled by Devito.},

Since its creation, the model and its acoustic finite-difference synthetic data have been used by hundreds of researchers throughout the world for a multitude of geophysical purposes, and to this day remains one of the most published geophysical data sets. The advancement in computer hardware capabilities since the late 1980s has made it possible to perform a major upgrade to the model and data set, thereby extending the usefulness of the model for, hopefully, some time to come. This paper outlines the creation of an updated and upgraded Marmousi model and data set which we have named Marmousi2. }

  abstract	= {Full-waveform inversion is challenging in complex geologic
	areas. Even when provided with an accurate starting model,
	the inversion algorithms often struggle to update the
	velocity model. Compared with other areas in applied
	geophysics, including prior information in full-waveform
	inversion is still in its relative infancy. In part, this
	is due to the fact that it is difficult to incorporate
	prior information that relates to geologic settings where
	strong discontinuities in the velocity model dominate,
	because these settings call for nonsmooth regularizations.
	We tackle this problem by including constraints on the
	spatial variations and value ranges of the inverted
	velocities, as opposed to adding penalties to the
	objective, which is more customary in mainstream
	geophysical inversion. By demonstrating the lack of
	predictability of edge-preserving inversion when the
	regularization is in the form of an added penalty term, we
	advocate the inclusion of constraints instead. Our examples
	show that the latter leads to more predictable results and
	to significant improvements in the delineation of salt
	bodies when these constraints are relaxed gradually in
	combination with extending the search space to
	approximately fit the observed data but not the noise.},

  abstract	= {In reverse time migration (RTM) or full-waveform inversion
	(FWI), forward and reverse time propagating wavefields are
	crosscorrelated in time to form either the image condition
	in RTM or the misfit gradient in FWI. The crosscorrelation
	condition requires both fields to be available at the same
	time instants. For large-scale 3D problems, it is not
	possible, in practice, to store snapshots of the wavefields
	during forward modeling due to extreme storage
	requirements. We have developed an approximate wavefield
	reconstruction method that uses particle velocity field
	recordings on the boundaries to reconstruct the forward
	wavefields during the computation of the reverse time

This relaxation aims to beat the multimodality typical of full-waveform inversion. However it prevents the use of time-marching solvers for the augmented equation and, as a consequence, cannot be straightforwardly employed to large 3D problems. In this work, we formulate a dual version of wavefield reconstruction inversion amenable to explicit time-domain solvers, yielding a robust and scalable inversion technique.},

    abstract = {Seismic full waveform inversion (FWI) has been applied to simple elastic problems with certain symmetries, such as isotropic, transverse isotropic or vertical transversely isotropic media. In this study, the FWI concept is extended to the most general anisotropic case with 21 independent elastic material parameters and no symmetry plane (triclinic). Beside a short description of the 3-D finite-difference scheme to solve the forward problem and the FWI optimization algorithm, we present a sensitivity study for a simple anisotropic medium. This test problem consists of a homogenous triclinic anisotropic full space, which contains 21 spatially separated spheres. In each sphere one component of the elastic tensor deviates by 5 per cent from the background medium. The resolution of the different spheres, ambiguities between the different elastic parameters, as well as the effect of the acquisition geometry can be systematically investigated. Due to the high computational costs of the triclinic forward problem a few compromises have to be made regarding the acquisition geometries. Point sources are replaced by plane wave sources which lead to a limitation of incidence angles and therefore a strong decrease in resolution of the nondiagonal elastic tensor components. It is shown that, despite these limitations, a tomographic acquisition geometry would be able to resolve to some extent a monoclinic symmetry via FWI. Restricting the acquisition geometries (e.g. VSP combined with reflection seismic or reflection seismic only) significantly reduces the number of resolvable tensor elements in strict dependence of the covered incidence angles.},

abstract = "3D geological underground models are often presented by vector data, such as triangulated networks representing boundaries of geological bodies and geological structures. Since models are to be used for numerical simulations based on the finite difference method, they have to be converted into a representation discretizing the full volume of the model into hexahedral cells. Often the simulations require a high grid resolution and are done using parallel computing. The storage of such a high-resolution raster model would require a large amount of storage space and it is difficult to create such a model using the standard geomodelling packages. Since the raster representation is only required for the calculation, but not for the geometry description, we present an algorithm and concept for rasterizing geological models on the fly for the use in finite difference codes that are parallelized by domain decomposition. As a proof of concept we implemented a rasterizer library and integrated it into seismic simulation software that is run as parallel code on a UNIX cluster using the Message Passing Interface. We can thus run the simulation with realistic and complicated surface-based geological models that are created using 3D geomodelling software, instead of using a simplified representation of the geological subsurface using mathematical functions or geometric primitives. We tested this set-up using an example model that we provide along with the implemented library."

	abstract = {Accurate forward modeling is essential for solving inverse problems in exploration seismology. Unfortunately, it is often not possible to afford being physically or numerically accurate. To overcome this conundrum, we make use of raw and processed data from nearby surveys. We propose to use this data, consisting of shot records or velocity models, to pre-train a neural network to correct for the effects of, for instance, the free surface or numerical dispersion, both of which can be considered as proxies for incomplete or inaccurate physics. Given this pre-trained neural network, we apply transfer learning to finetune this pre-trained neural network so it performs well on its task of mapping low-cost, but low-fidelity, solutions to high-fidelity solutions for the current survey. As long as we can limit ourselves during finetuning to using only a small fraction of high-fidelity data, we gain processing the current survey while using information from nearby surveys. We demonstrate this principle by removing surface-related multiples and ghosts from shot records and the effects of numerical dispersion from migrated images and wave simulations},

Transmission conditions based on the perfectly matched layer (PML) are derived that avoid artificial reflections and match incoming and outgoing waves at the subdomain interfaces. We focus on a subdivision of the rectangular domain into many thin subdomains along one of the axes, in combination with a certain ordering for solving the subdomain problems and a GMRES outer iteration. When combined with multifrontal methods, the solver has near-linear cost in examples, due to very small iteration numbers that are essentially independent of problem size and number of subdomains. It is to our knowledge only the second method with this property next to the moving PML sweeping method."

abstract = { In passive seismic interferometry, new reflection data can be retrieved by crosscorrelating recorded noise data. The quality of the retrieved reflection data is, among others, dependent on the duration and number of passive sources present during the recording time, the source distribution, and the source strength. To investigate these relations we set up several numerical modeling studies. To carry out the modeling in a feasible time, we design a finite-difference algorithm for the simulation of long-duration passive seismic measurements of band-limited noise signatures in the subsurface. Novel features of the algorithm include the modeling of thousands of randomly placed sources during one modeling run. The modeling experiments explore the dependency relation between the retrieved reflections and source-signature length, source positions, number of sources, and source amplitude variations. From these experiments we observed that the positions of the passive sources and the length of the source signals are of direct influence on the quality of the retrieved reflections. Random amplitude variations among source signals do not seem to have a big impact on the retrieved reflections. }

  abstract	= {Many inverse and parameter estimation problems can be
	written as PDE-constrained optimization problems. The goal
	is to infer the parameters, typically coefficients of the
	PDE, from partial measurements of the solutions of the PDE
	for several right-hand sides. Such PDE-constrained problems
	can be solved by finding a stationary point of the
	Lagrangian, which entails simultaneously updating the
	parameters and the (adjoint) state variables. For
	large-scale problems, such an all-at-once approach is not
	feasible as it requires storing all the state variables. In
	this case one usually resorts to a reduced approach where
	the constraints are explicitly eliminated (at each
	iteration) by solving the PDEs. These two approaches, and
	variations thereof, are the main workhorses for solving
	PDE-constrained optimization problems arising from inverse
	problems. In this paper, we present an alternative method
	that aims to combine the advantages of both approaches. Our
	method is based on a quadratic penalty formulation of the
	constrained optimization problem. By eliminating the state
	variable, we develop an efficient algorithm that has
	roughly the same computational complexity as the
	conventional reduced approach while exploiting a larger
	search space. Numerical results show that this method
	indeed reduces some of the nonlinearity of the problem and
	is less sensitive to the initial iterate.},

	receivers is inevitable in field seismic acquisitions.
	Consequently, time-lapse surveys become particularly
	expensive since current practices aim to replicate densely
	sampled surveys for monitoring changes occurring in the
	reservoir due to hydrocarbon production. We demonstrate
	that under certain circumstances, high-quality prestack
	data can be obtained from cheap randomized subsampled
	measurements that are observed from nonreplicated surveys.
	We extend our time-jittered marine acquisition to
	time-lapse surveys by designing acquisition on irregular
	spatial grids that render simultaneous, subsampled and
	irregular measurements. Using the fact that different
	time-lapse data share information and that nonreplicated
	surveys add information when prestack data are recovered
	jointly, we recover periodic densely sampled and colocated
	prestack data by adapting the recovery method to
	incorporate a regularization operator that maps traces from
	an irregular spatial grid to a regular periodic grid. The
	recovery method is, therefore, a combined operation of
	regularization, interpolation (estimating missing fine-grid
	traces from subsampled coarse-grid data), and source
	separation (unraveling overlapping shot records). By
	relaxing the insistence on replicability between surveys,
	we find that recovery of the time-lapse difference shows
	little variability for realistic field scenarios of
	slightly nonreplicated surveys that suffer from unavoidable
	natural deviations in spatial sampling of shots (or
	receivers) and pragmatic compressed-sensing based
	nonreplicated surveys when compared to the "ideal" scenario
	of exact replicability between surveys. Moreover, the
	recovered densely sampled prestack baseline and monitor
	data improve significantly when the acquisitions are not
	replicated, and hence can serve as input to extract
	poststack attributes used to compute time-lapse
	differences. Our observations are based on experiments
	conducted for an ocean-bottom cable survey acquired with
	time-jittered continuous recording assuming source
	equalization (or same source signature) for the time-lapse
	surveys and no changes in wave heights, water column
	velocities or temperature and salinity profiles, etc.},

	by the introduction of the so-called inverse scattering
	imaging condition, which naturally removes these artifacts.
	In this work, we derive the corresponding linearized
	forward operator of the inverse scattering imaging operator
	and incorporate this forward/adjoint operator pair into a
	sparsity-promoting (SPLS-RTM) workflow. We demonstrate on a
	challenging salt model, that LS-RTM with the inverse
	scattering imaging condition is far less prone to
	low-frequency artifacts than the conventional
	cross-correlation imaging condition, improves the
	convergence and does not require any type of additional
	image filters within the inversion. Through source
	subsampling and sparsity promotion, we reduce the
	computational cost in terms of PDE solves to a number
	comparable to conventional RTM, making our workflow
	applicable to large-scale problems.},

	abstract = {Writing software packages for seismic inversion is a very challenging task, since problems such as full-waveform inversion or least-squares imaging are both algorithmically and computationally demanding due to the large number of unknown parameters and the fact that we are propagating waves over many wavelengths. Software frameworks therefore need to combine both versatility and performance to provide geophysicists with the means and flexibility to implement complex algorithms that scale to exceedingly large 3D problems. Following these principles, we introduce the Julia Devito Inversion framework, an open-source software package in Julia for large-scale seismic modeling and inversion based on Devito, a domain-specific language compiler for automatic code generation. The framework consists of matrix-free linear operators for implementing seismic inversion algorithms that closely resembles the mathematical notation, a flexible resilient parallelization and an interface to Devito for generating optimized stencil code to solve the underlying wave equations. In comparison to many manually optimized industry codes written in low-level languages, our software is built on the idea of independent layers of abstractions and user interfaces with symbolic operators, making it possible to manage both the complexity of algorithms and performance optimizations, while preserving modularity, which allows for a level of expressiveness needed to formulate a broad range of wave-equation-based inversion problems. Through a series of numerical examples, we demonstrate that this allows users to implement algorithms for waveform inversion and imaging as simple Julia scripts that scale to large-scale 3D problems; thus providing a truly performant research and production framework.},

	abstract = {Least-squares reverse-time migration is a powerful approach for true amplitude seismic imaging of complex geological structures, but the successful application of this method is currently hindered by its enormous computational cost, as well as high memory requirements for computing the gradient of the objective function. We tackle these problems by introducing an algorithm for low-cost sparsity-promoting least-squares migration using on-the-fly Fourier transforms. We formulate the least-squares migration objective function in the frequency domain and compute gradients for randomized subsets of shot records and frequencies, thus significantly reducing data movement and the number of overall wave equations solves. By using on-the-fly Fourier transforms, we can compute an arbitrary number of monochromatic frequency-domain wavefields with a time-domain modeling code, instead of having to solve individual Helmholtz equations for each frequency, which quickly becomes computationally infeasible when moving to high frequencies. Our numerical examples demonstrate that compressive imaging with on-the-fly Fourier transforms provides a fast and memory-efficient alternative to time-domain imaging with optimal checkpointing, whose memory requirements for a fixed background model and source wavelet is independent of the number of time steps. Instead, memory and additional computational cost grow with the number of frequencies and determine the amount of subsampling artifacts and crosstalk. In contrast to optimal checkpointing, this offers the possibility to trade both memory and computational cost for image quality or a larger number of iterations and is advantageous in new computing environments such as the cloud, where compute is often cheaper than memory and data movement.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing has seen a large rise in popularity in recent years and is becoming a cost effective alternative to on-premise computing, with theoretically unlimited scalability. However, so far little progress has been made in adapting the cloud for high performance computing (HPC) tasks, such as seismic imaging and inversion. As the cloud does not provide the same type of fast and reliable connections as conventional HPC clusters, porting legacy codes developed for HPC environments to the cloud is ineffective and misses out on an opportunity to take advantage of new technologies presented by the cloud. We present a novel approach of bringing seismic imaging and inversion workflows to the cloud, which does not rely on a traditional HPC environment, but is based on serverless and event-driven computations. Computational resources are assigned dynamically in response to events, thus minimizing idle time and providing resilience to hardware failures. We test our workflow on two large-scale imaging examples and demonstrate that cost-effective HPC in the cloud is possible, but requires careful reconsiderations of how to bring software to the cloud.},

	abstract = {In {\textquotedblleft}A large-scale framework for symbolic implementations of seismic inversion algorithms in Julia,{\textquotedblright} Witte et al. describe new developments in how to code complex geophysical algorithms in a concise way. Subsurface seismic imaging and parameter estimation are among the most computationally challenging problems in the scientific community. Codes for solving seismic inverse problems, such as FWI or least-squares reverse time migration (LS-RTM), need to be highly optimized, but at the same time, facilitate the implementation of complex optimization algorithms. Traditionally, production-level codes in the oil and gas industry were exclusively written in low-level languages, such as C or Fortran, with extensive amounts of manual performance optimizations, thus making code maintenance, debugging, and adoption of new algorithms prohibitively challenging. Witte et al. present a paradigm of software engineering for seismic inverse problems based on symbolic user interfaces and code generation with automated performance optimization. Inspired by recent deep learning frameworks, the Julia Devito inversion framework (JUDI; an open-source software package) combines high-level abstractions for expressing seismic inversion algorithms with a domain-specific language compiler called Devito for solving the underlying wave equations. Devito{\textquoteright}s generated code is compiled just in time and outperforms codes with manual performance optimizations. JUDI utilizes Julia{\textquoteright}s high-level parallelization, making the software easily adaptable to a variety of computing environments such as densely connected HPC clusters or the cloud. The numerical examples (Figure 3) demonstrate the ability to implement a variety of complex algorithms for FWI and LS-RTM in a few lines of Julia code and run it on large-scale 3D models. The paper concludes that abstractions and performance are not mutually exclusive, and use of symbolic user interfaces can facilitate the implementation of new and innovative seismic inversion algorithms.},

Simulations benefit from recent advances in hexahedral meshing, load balancing and software optimization. Meshing may be accomplished using a mesh generation tool kit such as CUBIT, and load balancing is facilitated by graph partitioning based on the SCOTCH library. Coupling between fluid and solid regions is incorporated in a straightforward fashion using domain decomposition. Topography, bathymetry and Moho undulations may be readily included in the mesh, and physical dispersion and attenuation associated with anelasticity are accounted for using a series of standard linear solids. Finite-frequency Fréchet derivatives are calculated using adjoint methods in both fluid and solid domains. The software is benchmarked for a layercake model. We present various examples of fully unstructured meshes, snapshots of wavefields and finite-frequency kernels generated by Version 2.0 ‘Sesame’ of our widely used open source spectral-element package SPECFEM3D.},

abstract = { ABSTRACTThe spectral element method (SEM) has gained tremendous popularity within the seismological community to solve the wave equation at all scales. Classic SEM applications mostly rely on degrees 4–8 elements in each tensorial direction. Higher degrees are usually not considered due to two main reasons. First, high degrees imply large elements, which make the meshing of mechanical discontinuities difficult. Second, the SEM’s collocation points cluster toward the edge of the elements with the degree, degrading the time-marching stability criteria and imposing a small time step and a high numerical cost. Recently, the homogenization method has been introduced in seismology. This method can be seen as a preprocessing step before solving the wave equation that smooths out the internal mechanical discontinuities of the elastic model. It releases the meshing constraint and makes use of very high degree elements more attractive. Thus, we address the question of memory and computing time efficiency of very high degree elements in SEM, up to degree 40. Numerical analyses reveal that, for a fixed accuracy, very high degree elements require less computer memory than low-degree elements. With minimum sampling points per minimum wavelength of 2.5, the memory needed for a degree 20 is about a quarter that of the one necessary for a degree 4 in two dimensions and about one-eighth in three dimensions. Moreover, for the SEM codes tested in this work, the computation time with degrees 12–24 can be up to twice faster than the classic degree 4. This makes SEM with very high degrees attractive and competitive for solving the wave equation in many situations. }
